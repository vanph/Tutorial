1.Types:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/
C# is a strongly-typed language	

2.Reference Type and Value Types
http://net-informations.com/faq/general/valuetype-referencetype.htm
http://net-informations.com/faq/net/stack-heap.htm

Every type is a value type or reference type
- Use struct to create a value type
- Use class to create a reference type
Value types are usually immutable
- Can not change the value of 4
- Can not change the value of August 9th, 2002
Arrays and strings are reference types
-Strings behave like a value type

5. Boxing vs Unboxing vs Casting

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/how-to-safely-cast-by-using-as-and-is-operators

Unboxing is converting a value type to a reference type. Casting is converting a reference type to a reference type or a value type as another value type.
int i = 0;
object o = (object)i; //this is boxing
int i2 = (int)o; //this is unboxing.
long l = (long)i; //this is casting.

1. Extension methods:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods
Feature and Property of Extension Methods 
-It is a static method.
- It must be located in a static class.
- It uses the "this" keyword as the first parameter with a type in .NET and this method will be called by a given type instance on the client side.
- It also shown by VS intellisense. When we press the dot (.) after a type instance, then it comes in VS intellisense.
